# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect email spam using Python. The primary goal is to develop an effective system that can classify emails as either spam or not spam based on various features extracted from the email content.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning techniques for spam detection.
- Implemented in Python, taking advantage of its powerful libraries and tools.
- Uses [insert libraries/frameworks used, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.] for machine learning tasks.
- The model is trained on a labeled dataset with both spam and non-spam emails.
